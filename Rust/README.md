# The Rust Programming Language Notes

* Rust is a compiled language
* [Home Page](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
  * [Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
  * [Reference Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/index.html)
* [Source Code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
* [The Rust communityâ€™s crate registry](https://crates.io/)

## Installation

To install the Rust programming language and the related tools, type:
```sh
$ dnf install rust rust-doc cargo rustfmt
```

## Tools

### Cargo

[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) ([source code](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo))
is a package manager for Rust. A package in the Rust world is called *crate*.
Using `cargo` is a recommended way how to create and maintain Rust projects.

* To create a new project in Rust, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo new project_slug
  ```
  This creates the `project_slug` directory with `Cargo.toml` project
  configuration file and `src/` directory containing project sources. The
  content of `Cargo.toml` has the following structure:
  ```toml
  [package]
  # The name of the package, e.g. "foo":
  name = "<name>"
  # The version of the package, e.g. "0.1.0":
  version = "<version>"
  # The Rust language edition used to compile this project, e.g. "2021":
  edition = "<edition>"

  [dependencies]
  # A dependency is of the format `<crate name> = "<version>"`, where <version>
  # follows the semantic versioning scheme. An example of a dependency is
  # `rand = "0.8.5"`, where "0.8.5" is a shorthand for "^0.8.5" which means any
  # version that is at least "0.8.5" but below "0.9.0". Cargo considers that
  # any of these versions are compatible with "0.8.5".
  ```
* To build the project, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo build
  ```
  This will build your project and
  1. puts the resultant executable inside `./target/debug` directory;
  1. creates `Cargo.lock` keeping the track of exact versions of project
     dependencies. When you run `cargo build` first time, Cargo resolves the
     project dependencies and writes the exact versions of crates to
     `Cargo.lock`. Next time Cargo reuse the information from `Cargo.lock`
     instead of resolving dependencies again. If a dependency needs to be
     updated, run `cargo update`.
* To build a release of your project, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo build --release
  ```
  This will build your project with enabled optimizations and put the resultant
  executable inside `./target/release` directory.
* To build and run the project, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo run
  ```
* To check whether the project compiles, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo check
  ```
  This will produce no executable.
* To update the project dependencies, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo update
  ```
  This will look for new bug fixes of crates, download them and update
  `Cargo.lock`.
* To launch the documentation of your project dependencies, type:
  ```sh
  cargo doc --open
  ```

### Rust Code Format Checker

`rustfmt` formats a Rust code using the Rust code style conventions.

* To check the code style of one file, type:
  ```sh
  $ rustfmt --check file.rs
  ```

### Rust Compiler

[`rustc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html) compiles a rust project
into its binary representation.

* To compile a Rust project, type:
  ```sh
  $ rustc main.rs
  ```
  All you need is just to pass your project's root file to `rustc` (here
  `main.rs`) and `rustc` will automatically gather all the necessary source
  files, compiles them and links them together.

## Project Structure

A *crate* is viewed as a translation unit.

## Lexical Elements

### Keywords

See [Appendix A: Keywords] from the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Data Types

## Declarations

### Variables

* variables are defined using the `let` keyword
* by default, variables are defined as immutable
  * to define a mutable variable use the `mut` keyword
* variables are scoped
* the variable definition statement:
  ```
  "let" "mut"? variable_identifier (":" type)? "=" expression ";"
  ```
* examples:
  ```rust
  let x = 5;      // immutable variable
  let mut y = 7;  // mutable variable
  ```
* variables can be shadowed:
  ```rust
  let x = "foo";    // x is immutable and str
  let x = x.len();  // x is shadowed - still immutable but integer
  ```

### Constants

* always immutable
* scoped
* the constant definition statement:
  ```
  "const" constant_identifier ":" type "=" constant_expression ";"
  ```
* example:
  ```rust
  const THREE: u32 = 1 + 2;
  ```
* convention: use upper case and underscores for constant names
* for explanation of `constant_expression`, see
  [Constant evaluation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/const_eval.html)
