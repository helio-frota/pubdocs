## Installation

To install the Rust programming language and the related tools, type:
```sh
$ dnf install rust rust-doc cargo rustfmt
```

On non-Fedora based systems:
```sh
$ : "${RUST_PROFILE:=defualt}"  # Other possibilities: minimal, complete
$ curl curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y --profile ${RUST_PROFILE}
```

## Tools

### Cargo

[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) ([source code](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo))
is a package manager for Rust. A package in the Rust world is called *crate*.
Using `cargo` is a recommended way how to create and maintain Rust projects.

* To create a new project in Rust, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo new --name project_name project_slug
  ```
  This creates the `project_slug` directory with `Cargo.toml` project
  configuration file and `src/` directory containing project sources. The
  content of `Cargo.toml` has the following structure:
  ```toml
  [package]
  # The name of the package, e.g. "foo":
  name = "<name>"
  # The version of the package, e.g. "0.1.0":
  version = "<version>"
  # The Rust language edition used to compile this project, e.g. "2021":
  edition = "<edition>"

  [dependencies]
  # A dependency is of the format `<crate name> = "<version>"`, where <version>
  # follows the semantic versioning scheme. An example of a dependency is
  # `rand = "0.8.5"`, where "0.8.5" is a shorthand for "^0.8.5" which means any
  # version that is at least "0.8.5" but below "0.9.0". Cargo considers that
  # any of these versions are compatible with "0.8.5".
  ```
  When `--name` is omitted, the name of the project is derived from the name of
  the project directory (`project_slug`).
* To build the project, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo build
  ```
  This will build your project and
  1. puts the resultant executable inside `./target/debug` directory;
  1. creates `Cargo.lock` keeping the track of exact versions of project
     dependencies. When you run `cargo build` first time, Cargo resolves the
     project dependencies and writes the exact versions of crates to
     `Cargo.lock`. Next time Cargo reuse the information from `Cargo.lock`
     instead of resolving dependencies again. If a dependency needs to be
     updated, run `cargo update`.
* To build a release of your project, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo build --release
  ```
  This will build your project with enabled optimizations and put the resultant
  executable inside `./target/release` directory.
* To build and run the project, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo run
  ```
* To check whether the project compiles, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo check
  ```
  This will produce no executable.
* To update the project dependencies, type:
  ```sh
  $ cargo update
  ```
  This will look for new bug fixes of crates, download them and update
  `Cargo.lock`.
* To launch the documentation of your project dependencies, type:
  ```sh
  cargo doc --open
  ```

### Rust Code Format Checker

`rustfmt` formats a Rust code using the Rust code style conventions.

* To check the code style of one file, type:
  ```sh
  $ rustfmt --check file.rs
  ```

### Rust Compiler

[`rustc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html) compiles a rust project
into its binary representation.

* To compile a Rust project, type:
  ```sh
  $ rustc main.rs
  ```
  All you need is just to pass your project's root file to `rustc` (here
  `main.rs`) and `rustc` will automatically gather all the necessary source
  files, compiles them and links them together.

### Miri

[Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) is a mid-level intermediate
representation interpreter. It can run Rust programs and detect certain classes
of undefined behavior.

```
* a character in a `string_literal` is any Unicode Scalar Value (U+0000 to
  U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive) except double quote (U+0022),
  backslash (U+005C), and sole carriage return (U+000D); U+000D U+000A is
  translated to U+000A
* in a `string_literal`, if `(U+000D? U+000A)` immediatelly follows a backslash
  character, then the backslash character, the `(U+000D? U+000A)` and the
  following string containing only U+0020, U+000A, U+000D and U+0009 characters
  are removed from the `string_literal`
* a character in a `raw_string_literal` is any Unicode Scalar Value (U+0000 to
  U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive) except sole carriage return (U+000D)

```
* `_` works as a digit separator and is ignored (increases number readability)
* after macro expansion, `suffix` should be one of `u8`, `i8`, `u16`, `i16`,
  `u32`, `i32`, `u64`, `i64`, `u128`, `i128`, `usize` or `isize`
  * `byte_literal` `suffix` should be `u8`
* if there is no type suffix, `i32` is used
* see [Byte literals](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/tokens.html#byte-literals),
  [Integer literals](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/tokens.html#integer-literals)
  and [Integer literal expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/literal-expr.html#integer-literal-expressions)

    dec_literal "."{not-followed-by ("." | "_" | <XID start Unicode character>)}
    dec_literal "." dec_literal suffix_no_e?
    dec_literal ("." dec_literal)? float_exponent suffix?

float_exponent:
    ("e" | "E") ("+" | "-")? (dec_digit | "_")* dec_digit (dec_digit | "_")*
```
* after macros are expanded, `suffix` should be either `f32` or `f64`
* if there is no type suffix, `f64` is used
* see [Floating-point literals](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/tokens.html#floating-point-literals)
  and [Floating-point literal expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/literal-expr.html#floating-point-literal-expressions)
  for greater detail

## Data Types

* Rust can infer a variable's data type
  * in case of more than one possible data types, a variable must be annotated
    with a data type

### Never Type

* `!`
* has no values
* represent the result of computations that never complete
* see [Never type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/never.html) for
  greater detail

### Scalar Types

#### Boolean Type

* `bool`
* one byte in size
* two possible values: `true` and `false`
* see [Boolean type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/boolean.html)
  for greater detail

#### Character Type

* `char`
* 4 bytes in size
* see [Textual types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/textual.html)
  for greater detail

#### Integer Types

| **Signed** | **Unsigned** | **Size** |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------- |
| `i8` | `u8` | 8 bits |
| `i16` | `u16` | 16 bits |
| `i32` | `u32` | 32 bits |
| `i64` | `u64` | 64 bits |
| `i128` | `u128` | 128 bits |
| `isize` | `usize` | machine specific |

See [Integer types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/numeric.html#integer-types)
and [Machine-dependent integer types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/numeric.html#machine-dependent-integer-types)
for greater detail.

#### Floating Point Types

* `f32` and `f64` with 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively
* IEEE-754
* default is `f64`
* see [Floating-point types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/numeric.html#floating-point-types)
  for greater detail

### Compound Types

#### Tuple Type

* tuples are finite sequences of values, where two values may have distinct
  types
* at the syntactical level, a tuple is a comma-separated list of elements
  (items) enclosed between parentheses:
  ```
  "(" ((item ",")+ item?)? ")"
  ```
* an item can be either type or expression or identifier
* an example of assigning a tuple to the variable:
  ```rust
  let tup = ("foo", 1, 0.5);
  ```
* with type annotations:
  ```rust
  let tup: (str, i32, f64) = ("foo", 1, 0.5);
  ```
* elements can be extracted from a tuple using either dot expression or
  destructuring assignment
* dot expression has a form `tuple "." index`, where `index` is a non-negative
  integer literal in decimal notation not exceeding the tuple size minus one
  (tuple indices are zero-based); example:
  ```rust
  let point = (3, 5);

  let x = point.0;
  let y = point.1;
  ```
* destructuring assignment:
  ```rust
  let point = (3, 5);

  let (x, y) = point;
  ```

##### Unit

* *empty tuple*
* both unit type and unit value are written as `()`
* represent an empty value or an empty return type
* empty value is returned implicitly by an expression

See [Tuple types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/tuple.html) and
[Tuple and tuple indexing expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/tuple-expr.html)
for greater detail.

#### Array Type

* arrays are finite sequences of values of same type
* unlike in other programming languages arrays have fixed length
* in Rust, array are allocated on stack
* at the syntactical level, an array is a comma-separated list of elements
  (items) enclosed between brackets:
  ```
  "[" (item ("," item)*)? "]"
  ```
* an example of an array assigned to the variable:
  ```rust
  let arr = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];
  ```
* an array annotation consists of a type and the number of elements in the
  array; the exact notation is `"[" type ";" size "]"`, example:
  ```rust
  let arr: [u8; 4] = [1, 2, 4, 8];
  ```
* arrays can be initialized by `"[" value ";" count "]"` expression:
  ```rust
  let arr = [2; 4];  // same as `let arr = [2, 2, 2, 2];`
  ```
* to access the element of an array, use `array "[" index "]"` expression:
  ```rust
  let arr = ["a", "b"];

  let a = arr[0];  // a == "a"
  let b = arr[1];  // b == "b"
  ```
* like tuples, array indices are zero-based
* indexing an array out of its bounds make a program panicking
* see [Array types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/array.html) and
  [Array and array index expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/array-expr.html)
  for greater detail

#### Reference Types

* a general signature for a reference types is
  ```
  "&" ("'" identifier | "'" "static" | "'" "_")? "mut"? type_no_bounds
  ```
* if `mut` is not present, a refernce is called a *shared* reference
  * it points to a memory location owned by other value
  * prevents direct mutation of the value (exception to this rule is interior
    mutability)
  * there can be any number of shared references to a value
  * a reference type implements `Copy`
  * referencing a temporal value keeps it alive during the lifetime of the
    reference itself
* if `mut` is present, a reference is called a *mutable* reference
  * like shared reference, it also points to a memory location owned by other
    value
  * allows direct mutation of the value
    * the value must not be borrowed yet
  * only one mutable reference per value can exists
* see [References (& and &mut)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/pointer.html#references--and-mut)
  for greater detail

#### Struct Types

* a `struct` type is a heterogeneous product of other types
* `struct`s have no specified memory layout
  * to specify one, use [`repr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#representations)
    attribute
* see [Struct types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/struct.html) for
  greater detail

## Declarations

### Variables

* variables are defined using the `let` keyword
* by default, variables are defined as immutable
  * to define a mutable variable use the `mut` keyword
* variables are scoped
* the variable definition statement:
  ```
  "let" "mut"? variable_identifier (":" type)? "=" expression ";"
  ```
* examples:
  ```rust
  let x = 5;      // immutable variable
  let mut y = 7;  // mutable variable
  ```
* variables can be shadowed:
  ```rust
  let x = "foo";    // x is immutable and str
  let x = x.len();  // x is shadowed - still immutable but integer
  ```
* see [Identifiers](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/identifiers.html),
  [`let` statements](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/statements.html#let-statements)
  and [Variables](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/variables.html) for
  greater detail

### Constants

* always immutable
* scoped
* the constant definition statement:
  ```
  "const" constant_identifier ":" type "=" constant_expression ";"
  ```
* example:
  ```rust
  const THREE: u32 = 1 + 2;
  ```
* convention: use upper case and underscores for constant names
* see [Constant items](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/constant-items.html)

### Structs

Grammar:
```
struct:
    "struct" identifier generic_params? where_clause?
        ("{" struct_fields? "}" | ";")
    "struct" identifier generic_params? "(" tuple_fields? ")" where_clause? ";"

struct_fields:
    struct_field ("," struct_field)* ","?
struct_field:
    outer_attribute* visibility? identifier ":" type

tuple_fields:
    tuple_field ("," tuple_field)* ","?
tuple_field:
    outer_attribute* visibility? type
```

#### Structs with Named Fields

Declaration:
```rust
struct Point3D {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    z: f64,
}
```
* declare a new type `Point3D` as a struct containing three `f64` items named
  `x`, `y` and `z`, respectively

Making an instance:
```rust
let p1 = Point3D {x: 0.5, y: -1.2, z: 1.0};      // (1)
let mut p2 = Point3D {z: 1.0, y: -1.2, x: 0.5};  // (2)
```
* at `(1)` an instance of `Point3D` is created and assigned to `p1`
* at `(2)` happens the same but this time the instance is assigned to `p2`
* the order of initializers does not matter in Rust, thus `p1` and `p2` are
  equal

Accessing an element:
```rust
p2.x += p1.x;
```
* an element of a struct is accessed by its name using dot operator (`.`)

Field init shorthand:
```rust
fn x_axis_point(x: f64) -> Point3D {
    Point {y: 0.0, z: 0.0, x}
}
```
* if the name of a variable coincides with the name of a field then initializer
  `name: name` can be shortened to just `name`

Struct update syntax:
```rust
let origin = Point3D {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0};
let z1 = Point3D {z: 1.0, ..origin};
```
* missing initializers are taken from `origin`, so the `z1` is equal to
  `Point3D {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.0}`
* note that in case `Point3D` contains a field that can be only moved (e.g. a
  field of `String` type), then `origin` cannot be used after the assignment to
  `z1` is finished
* `z1` must be of the same type as `origin`

#### Tuple-like Structs

Declaration:
```rust
struct Color(u8, u8, u8);
```
* declare a new type `Color` as a struct containing three `u8` elements

Making an instance:
```rust
let red = Color(255, 0, 0);
let ctor = Color;
let blue = ctor(0, 0, 255);
```
* create an instance of `Color` and assign it to `red`
* `Color` behaves like function/constructor

Accessing an element:
```rust
let green = red.1;
```
* elements are accessed like in tuples

Struct update:
```rust
let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let red = Color {0: 255, ..black};
```
* decimal integer literal as a field name specifies which field is updated
* `..origin` sets the rest of fields from `origin` using the copy/borrow
  strategy

#### Unit-like Structs

Declaration:
```rust
struct Ground;
struct Sink;
```
* declare two new distinct types, `Ground` and `Sink`, with no elements
* unit-like structs become useful when used together with traits

Making an instance:
```rust
let ground = Ground;
let ground2 = Ground {};
```
* create an instance of `Ground` and assign it to `ground`
* `Ground` can be optionally followed by `{}` to explicitly denote there are no
  fields

See [Structs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/structs.html) and
[Struct expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/struct-expr.html)
for greater detail.

## Ownership

* ownership is a strategy of keeping of a track of used memory
  * whether the memory is used or not is decided on compile time
* ownership rules
  1. every value in Rust has an owner
  1. there can be only one owner at a time
  1. when the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped (Rust calls
     [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop)
     on it)
* see [Pointer types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/pointer.html)
  and [Slice types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/slice.html) for
  greater detail

### Moves, Clones, and Copies

When a value is moved from one variable to another, the value of the former
variable is considered invalid and that variable cannot be used:
```rust
let a = String::from("Hey!");
let b = a;  // `a` cannot be used from now since its value is invalid
```

This can be bypassed using the `clone` method:
```rust
let a = String::from("Hello!");
let b = a.clone();  // both `a` and `b` stay valid
```

However, if a type implements the `Copy` trait, a value is not moved but copied
and it stays valid:
```rust
let x = 5;
ley y = x;  // `x` is valid since `i32` implements the `Copy` trait
```

**Note:** If a type or any of its part implements the `Drop` trait it cannot be
annotated with (it cannot implement) the `Copy` trait.

Types that can implement the `Copy` trait are in general:
* any group of simple scalar values
* nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource

This includes:
* all integer types
* `bool` type
* all floating-point types
* `char` type
* tuples containing only types implementing `Copy`

Moving and copying concepts hold also for functions and other assignment-like
operations:
* `function(x)` moves/copies `x` to its parameter
* `return x` moves/copies `x` outside of function as its return value

### References and Borrowing

* a reference is holding an address to some kind of data/value
* a reference lifetime starts with its definition and ends after its last use
  in the current scope
* a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid data/value during the reference
  lifetime
* a reference points to a value but it not owns it
  * a referenced value cannot be changed and thus there can be many references
    for the same memory location at the same time
* a reference is created using `&` unary operator
  * e.g., `&a` is a reference to the value owned by `a`
* `&` can be also used to declare a reference type
  * e.g., `&i32` is a reference type of `i32` type
* creating a reference is called *borrowing*
* using `mut` together with `&` creates/declares a *mutable* reference
  * `&mut a` is a mutable reference to the value of `a`
  * `&mut i32` is a mutable reference type of `i32` type
* a mutable reference allows to change the value it is referring to
  * no other references to that value are allowed to exist during the mutable
    reference lifetime

### Dangling Pointers

Rust will not allow dangling pointers:
```rust
fn dangle() {
    let s = String::from("Hey!");

    &s  // `s` goes out of scope so it is dropped; `&s` points to freed memory
}
```

### Slices

* a slice is a reference to contiguous sequence of elements in a collection
* a slice is made using index (`&x[r]`) expression, where `&x` is a reference
  to some collection type and `r` has a range type; the value of `&x[r]` is the
  reference to the portion of `x`; some examples:
  ```rust
  let s = String::from("abcdefgh");

  let x = &s[1..4];  // `x` points to `s[1]` ("bcd") and has type `&String`
  let y = &s[..3];   // same as `&s[0..3]`
  let z = &s[2..];   // same as `&s[2..(s.len())]`
  let w = &s[..];    // same as `&s[0..(s.len())]`

  // let t = &s[-1..0];  // error: `a` is not of a type `usize`
  // let t = &s[1..0];   // panic: `a` is not less or equal to `b`
  let t = &s[1..=0];     // ok: `t == ""`, `a <= b` (`1 <= 1`)
  // let t = &s[2..=0];  // panic: `a` is not less or equal to `b` (`2 > 1`)

  let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  let x = &a[1..3];  // `assert_eq!(x, &[2, 3]);`, `x` has type `&[i32]`
  ```
* **Note 1:** A range `a..b` used to make a slice must have `a <= b`, where
  both `a` and `b` are of the `usize` type.
* **Note 2:** String (`str`) slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8
  character boundaries. Otherwise the program panics.
* **Note 3:** String literals have a type `&str` since they are slices of a
  binary data stored in the data section of a program.
* **Note 4:** `String` implements the `Deref` trait that converts `&String` to
  `&str` by calling a `deref` method (the code is generated by Rust during
  compile time). As a consequence, if a function `fun` has a signature
  `fn fun(s: &str)` and `x` has a type `&String` we can `fun(x)` without any
  worries.

### Loop Expressions

Grammar:
```
loop_expression:
    loop_label? (
        "loop" block_expression
        "while" (expression - struct_expression) block_expression
        "while" "let" pattern "=" (scrutinee - lazy_boolean_expression)
            block_expression
        "for" pattern "in" (expression - struct_expression) block_expression
        block_expression
    )
loop_label:
    lifetime_or_label ":"

break_expression:
    "break" lifetime_or_label? expression?
continue_expression:
    "continue" lifetime_or_label?
```

`loop { body }`:
* execute `body` infinitely
* if `body` does not contain `break`, the type of the expression is `!`;
  otherwise, the type of the expression is the type of the `break` expression
* the type of the expression must be compatible with the type of every `break`
  expression inside `body`
* the value of the expression is the value returned by a `break` expression
  from `body`

`while condition { body }`:
* if `condition` is true execute `body` and go to the next iteration
* `condition` must not be `struct_expression`
* the type and the value of the expression, `body` and the `break` expression
  follow the same rules as in the `loop` case

`while let pattern = scrutinee { body }`:
* if the value of `scrutinee` matches `pattern` execute `body` and go to the
  next iteration
* `scrutinee` must not be `lazy_boolean_expression`
* the type and the value of the expression, `body` and the `break` expression
  follow the same rules as in the `loop` case

`for pattern in expression { body }`:
* `expression` must not be `struct_expression`
* the value of `expression` must implement
  [`std::iter::IntoIterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.IntoIterator.html)
* `pattern` must be irrefutable
* if the iterator yield a value, the value is matched against `pattern` and the
  `body` is executed after which the control returns to the next iteration
* a `'label: for pattern in expression { body }` is equivalent to
  ```rust
  {
      let result = match IntoIterator::into_iter(expression) {
          // Don't drop temporaries from `expression` before loop is finished
          mut iter => 'label: loop {
              let mut next;
              match Iterator::next(&mut iter) {
                  Option::Some(val) => next = val,
                  Option::None => break,
              };
              let pattern = next;
              let () = { body };
          },
      };
      result
  }
  ```

Loop labels:
* a loop expression can be optionally labeled
* labels can be shadowed
  ```rust
  'a: loop {         // (1)
      'a: loop {     // (2)
          break 'a;  // exit (2) loop
      }
      break 'a;      // exit (1) loop
  }
  ```

`break` expressions:
* allowed only inside of the body of a loop or a labeled block expression
* `break` immediately exits from the innermost loop or a labeled block
  expression
  * if a label is specified, `break` immediately exits from a loop labeled with
    this label
  * in a labeled block expression the label part is mandatory
* if the expression part is present, `break` returns the value of the
  expression to the associated loop or labeled block expression
  * just `break` returns `()`

`continue` expressions:
* allowed only inside of the body of a loop
* associated with the innermost loop expression
  * if the label part is present, the `continue` expression is associated with
    the loop expression labeled with this label
* `continue` immediately stops the current iteration and returns the control
  back to the associated loop so the next iteration can be started

See [Loops and other breakable expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/loop-expr.html#loops-and-other-breakable-expressions)
for greater detail.

### `if` Expressions

Grammar:
```
if_expression:
    "if" (expression - struct_expression) block_expression
        ("else" (block_expression | if_expression | if_let_expression))?

if_let_expression:
    "if" "let" pattern "=" (scrutinee - lazy_boolean_expression) block_expression
        ("else" (block_expression | if_expression | if_let_expression))?
```
* the conditional `expression` must not be `struct_expression` and must be of
  a type `bool`
* the `scrutinee` must not be `lazy_boolean_expression`
* all block expressions must have the same type
* the value of the `if` expression is the value of its *then* branch if the
  conditional expression evaluates to `true`; otherwise, the value of the `if`
  expression is the value of its *else* branch
* if neither *then* nor *else* branch are evaluated the value of the `if`
  expression is `()`
* in an `if let` expression, if the value of `scrutinee` matches `pattern` the
  whole expression has the value of its *then* branch; otherwise, it has the
  value of its *else* branch or `()` if the *else* branch is missing
  * `if let` expression
    ```rust
    if let PATTERN = EXPRESSION {
        then_branch
    }
    else {
        else_branch
    }
    ```
    is equivalent to
    ```rust
    match EXPRESSION {
        PATTERN => { then_branch },
        _ => { else_branch },
    }
    ```

See [`if` and `if let` expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/if-expr.html)
for greater detail.

### `return` Expressions

Grammar:
```
return_expression:
    "return" expression?
```

See [`return` expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/return-expr.html)
for greater detail.

### Range Expressions

Grammar:
```
range_expression:
    expression ".." expression
    expression ".."
    ".." expression
    ".."
    expression "..=" expression
    "..=" expression
```
* `a..b` constructs [`std::ops::Range`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/struct.Range.html)
  object; `(a..b).contains(&x)` is equivalent to `a <= x && x < b`
* `a..` constructs [`std::ops::RangeFrom`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/struct.RangeFrom.html)
  object; `(a..).contains(&x)` is equivalent to `a <= x`
* `..b` constructs [`std::ops::RangeTo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/struct.RangeTo.html)
  object; `(..b).contains(&x)` is equivalent to `x < b`
* `..` constructs [`std::ops::RangeFull`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/struct.RangeFull.html)
  object; this range has no boundaries
* `a..=b` constructs [`std::ops::RangeInclusive`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/struct.RangeInclusive.html)
  object; `(a..=b).contains(&x)` is equivalent to `a <= x && x <= b`
* `..=b` constructs [`std::ops::RangeToInclusive`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/struct.RangeToInclusive.html)
  object; `(..=b).contains(&x)` is equivalent to `x <= b`

See [Range expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/range-expr.html)
for greater detail.

### Lazy Boolean Expressions

Grammar:
```
lazy_boolean_expression:
    expression "&&" expression
    expression "||" expression
```

The meaning and associativity of each operator (operators lower in the table
have higher precedence):
| **Operator** | **Meaning** | **Associativity** |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| `\|\|` | logical or | left-to-right |
| `&&` | logical and | left-to-right |

`||` and `&&` differs from `|` and `&` in a way that the right-hand side
expression is evaluated when its value is needed.

See [Lazy boolean operators](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/operator-expr.html#lazy-boolean-operators)
for greater detail.

### Arithmetic and Logical Expressions

Grammar:
```
arithmetic_or_logical_expression:
    expression "+" expression
    expression "-" expression
    expression "*" expression
    expression "/" expression
    expression "%" expression
    expression "&" expression
    expression "|" expression
    expression "^" expression
    expression "<<" expression
    expression ">>" expression
```

The meaning and associativity of each operator (operators lower in the table
have higher precedence):
| **Operator** | **Meaning** | **Associativity** |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| `\|` | bitwise/logical or | left-to-right |
| `^` | bitwise/logical xor | left-to-right |
| `&` | bitwise/logical and | left-to-right |
| `<<`, `>>` | left shift, right shift | left-to-right |
| `+`, `-` | addition, subtraction | left-to-right |
| `*`, `/`, `%` | multiplication, division, remainder | left-to-right |

for greater detail.

#### Handling Integer Overflow

* arithmetic operations with integers may overflow
* in debug mode, overflow causes panic
* in `--release` mode, overflow causes unexpected results (caused by modulo
  arithmetic a.k.a. complement wrapping)
* Rust standard library provides methods for primitive types dealing with
  integer arithmetic:
  ```rust
  // wrapping_* methods do modular arithmetic
  assert_eq!(200u8.wrapping_add(100), 44);

  // checked_* methods return None in case of overflow
  assert_eq!(200u8.checked_add(100), None);

  // overflowing_* methods return the value and boolean indicating overflow
  assert_eq!(200u8.overflowing_add(100), (44, true));

  // saturating_* methods do a saturation
  assert_eq!(200u8.saturating_add(100), u8::MAX);
  ```

### Borrow Expressions

Grammar:
```
borrow_expression:
    ( "&" | "&&" ) "mut"? expression
```
* `&a` produces a reference if `a` is an expression with an associated memory
  location
* memory location associated with `a` is switched to a borrowed state for the
  entire duration of `&a`
  * for `&a` this means that `a` cannot be mutated, but it can be read or
    shared again
  * for `&mut a` this means that `a` cannot be accessed in any other way until
    `&mut a` expires (i.e. having two mutable references to the same place is
    considered invalid)
* if `a` is a value expression (i.e. it has no associated memory location, like
  `3 + 5`), then `&a` or `&mut a` yields a creation of a temporary memory
  location which is then referenced

See [Borrow operators](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/operator-expr.html#borrow-operators)
for greater detail.

### Array Index Expressions

Grammar:
```
index_expression:
    expression "[" expression "]"
```

See [Array and slice indexing expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/array-expr.html#array-and-slice-indexing-expressions)
for greater detail.

### Call Expressions

Grammar:
```
call_expression:
    expression "(" call_params? ")"

call_params:
    expression ("," expression)* ","?
```

See [Call expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/call-expr.html)
for greater detail.

### Field Access Expressions

Grammar:
```
field_expression:
    expression "." identifier

tuple_indexing_expression:
    expression "." integer_literal
```
* a tuple index is compared to the `integer_literal` directly
  * that is, `t.0` is valid but `t.01` or `t.0o0` are invalid
* see [Field access expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/field-expr.html)
  and [Tuple indexing expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/tuple-expr.html#tuple-indexing-expressions)
  for greater detail

### Method-Call Expressions

Grammar:
```
method_call_expression:
    expression "." path_expr_segment "(" call_params? ")"
```

`expression` in the grammar above is called *receiver*.

Here is how receiver and method are resolved:
1. Build a list, *L*, of candidate receiver types.
   1. Repeatedly [dereference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/operator-expr.html#the-dereference-operator)
      receiver's expression type, add each encountered type to *L*.
   1. Let *T* be the last type in *L*. Apply [unsized coercion](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-coercions.html#unsized-coercions)
      to *T* and add the result, if any, to *L*.
1. For each `T` in *L*, add `&T` and `&mut T` to *L* immediately after `T`.
1. For every *T* in *L*, search for a visible method with a receiver of type
   *T* in these places:
   1. Methods implemented directly on *T*.
   1. Any of the methods provided by a visible trait implemented by *T*.
      * If *T* is a type parameter, methods provided by trait bounds on *T* are
        looked up first.
      * Then all remaining methods in scope are looked up.
1. If the look up failed or there are ambiguities an error is issued.

See [Method-call expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/method-call-expr.html)
for greater detail.

### Block Expressions

Grammar:
```
block_expression:
    "{" inner_attribute* statements? "}"
statements:
    statement+ expression_without_block?
    expression_without_block
```

The value and type of `block_expression` is the value and type of `expression`
if it is present. Otherwise the value and type of `block_expression` is `()`.

See [Block expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/block-expr.html)
for greater detail.

    byte_literal
    byte_string_literal
    raw_byte_string_literal

    outer_attribute* (
        identifier
        | (identifier | integer_literal) ":" expression
    )
struct_base:
    ".." expression
```
* for `integer_literal` in `struct_expr_field` hold same restriction as for
  `integer_literal` in `tuple_indexing_expression`

## Statements

Following list of rules summarizes what is considered a statement:
* a sole `;` is a statement
* a function definition is a statement
* `let` statement
* an expression followed by `;` is a statement

See [Statements](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/statements.html) for
greater detail.

### `let` Statement

Grammar:
```
let_statement:
    outer_attribute* "let" pattern_no_top_alt (":" type)?
        ("=" expression ("else" block_expression)?)? ";"
```
* introduces a new set of variables given by a `pattern_no_top_alt`
* `pattern_no_top_alt` can be annotated with `type`
* variables in `pattern_no_top_alt` can be initialized by `expression`
* if `else` is not present, `pattern_no_top_alt` must be irrefutable
* if `else` is present
  * `pattern_no_top_alt` can be refutable
  * `expression` must not be a `lazy_boolean_expression` or end with a `}`
  * `block_expression` must evaluate to never type
* the semantics of `else` part is that if `pattern_no_top_alt` fails to match
  then the `block_expression` is executed
* see [`let` statements](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/statements.html#let-statements)
  for greater detail

## Generics

Grammar:
```
generic_params:
    "<" ">"
    "<" (generic_param ",")* generic_param ","? ">"
generic_param:
    outer_attribute* (lifetime_param | type_param | const_param)
lifetime_param:
    lifetime_or_label (":" lifetime_bounds)?
type_param:
    identifier (":" type_param_bounds?)? ("=" type)?
const_param:
    "const" identifier ":" type
        ("=" block_expression | identifier | "-"? literal_expression)?

where_clause:
    "where" (where_clause_item ",")* where_clause_item?
where_clause_item:
    lifetime ":" lifetime_bounds
    ("for" generic_params)? type ":" type_param_bounds?
```

## Traits

Grammar:
```
type_param_bounds:
    type_param_bound ("+" type_param_bound)* "+"?
type_param_bound:
    lifetime
    trait_bound
trait_bound:
    "?"? ("for" generic_params)? type_path
    "(" "?"? ("for" generic_params)? type_path ")"

lifetime_bounds:
    (lifetime "+")* lifetime?
lifetime:
    lifetime_or_label
    "'static"
    "'_"
```

## Implementations

Grammar:
```
implementation:
    inherent_impl
    trait_impl

inherent_impl:
    "impl" generic_params? type where_clause?
        "{" inner_attribute* associated_item* "}"
trait_impl:
    "unsafe"? "impl" generic_params? "!"? type_path "for" type where_clause?
        "{" inner_attribute* associated_item* "}"

associated_item:
    outer_attribute* (
        macro_invocation_semi
        | (visibility? (type_alias | constant_item | function))
    )
```

An implementation associates an item definition with a concrete type.
* this happens inside of `impl` block
* multiple `impl` blocks per one implementing type are possible

Inherent implementations:
* can contain associated functions, including methods, and associated constants
* a type can also have multiple inherent implementations
* an implementing type must be defined within the same crate as the original
  type definition

See [Implementations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html)
for greater detail.

### Associated Functions and Methods

Associated functions are functions associated with a type.

Methods are associated functions with `self` as the first parameter. The type
of `self`, `S`, can be specified, but it undergoes the following restrictions:
* Let `T` be an implementing type and `'a` by an arbitrary lifetime.
* Then `S` is one of `Self` or `P`, where
  * `Self` refers to a type resolving to `T`, such as alias of `T`, `Self`, or
    associated type projections resolving to `T`;
  * `P` is one of `& 'a S`, `& 'a mut S`, `Box<S>`, `Rc<S>`, `Arc<S>`, or
    `Pin<S>`.

When `self` has no type specified, then
* `self` is equivalent to `self: Self`
* `& 'a self` is equivalent to `self: & 'a Self`
* `& 'a mut self` is equivalent to `self: & 'a mut Self`

Explanation on example:
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct FsItem {
    name: String,
    size: usize,
}

impl FsItem {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            name: String::from(""),
            size: 0usize,
        }
    }

    fn create(name: String, size: usize) -> FsItem {
        FsItem { name, size }
    }

    fn name(&self) -> String {
        String::from(self.name.as_str())
    }

    fn size(&self) -> usize {
        self.size
    }

    fn rename(&mut self, name: String) {
        self.name = name;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut fsitem1 = FsItem::new();
    let fsitem2 = FsItem::create(String::from("/etc/fsitem2"), 16);

    println!("{fsitem1:#?}");
    println!("{fsitem2:#?}");

    println!("fsitem1 = {{ {}, {} }}", fsitem1.name(), fsitem1.size());

    fsitem1.rename(String::from("/etc/fsitem1"));

    println!("fsitem1 = {{ {}, {} }}", fsitem1.name(), fsitem1.size());
}
```
* `impl FsItem` block encloses functions and methods definitions associated
  with `struct FsItem`
* `new()` and `create()` are associated functions of `struct FsItem` and as
  such their path must be specified to call them: `FsItem::new()`,
  `FsItem::create()`
* `name()`, `size()`, and `rename()` are methods
  * they are called using [method-call expression](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/method-call-expr.html),
    e.g. `fsitem1.name()`
* `Self` refers to the implementing type, here `struct FsItem`
* `self` refers to the object of implementing type and it is an implicit
  parameter to the method
  * e.g. `x.f(a, b)` translates to `T::f(x, a, b)` where `T` is the type of the
    receiver or trait and `x` matches with `self`
* `mut` before `self` denotes that a method modifies the object referred by
  `self`
* `&` is necessary if the object referred by `self` is borrowed more than once
  * e.g. `fsitem1` is borrowed by `name()` and by `size()`

## Macros

Grammar:
```
macro_invocation:
    simple_path "!" delim_token_tree
macro_invocation_semi:
    simple_path "!" "(" token_tree* ")" ";"
    simple_path "!" "[" token_tree* "]" ";"
    simple_path "!" "{" token_tree* "}"

delim_token_tree:
    "(" token_tree* ")"
    "[" token_tree* "]"
    "{" token_tree* "}"
token_tree:
    token - delimiters
    delim_token_tree
```

### Selected Macros from the Standard Library

#### `format`

Creates a [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html)
by the interpolation of format string literal. Example:
```rust
let (x, y) = (1, 2);

format!("x = {x}, y = {y}");     // "x = 1, y = 2"
format!("z = {z}", z = 3);       // "z = 3"
format!("Hello, {}!", "World");  // "Hello, World!"
```

See [`std::format`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format.html) for
greater detail.

##### Format String

A format string is a string containing markers with format specification. A
marker is a string starting with `{` and ending with `}`. During interpolation,
a marker is replaced by the string representation of the corresponding value.
Additional characters between `{` and `}` specify a way of interpolating a
value.

Selected markers:
| **Marker** | **Meaning** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `{}` | the value's type must implement [`std::fmt::Display`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html) trait |
| `{:?}` | the value's type must implement [`std::fmt::Debug`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html) trait |
| `{:#?}` | `{:?}` with pretty print flag set |

See [`std::fmt`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/index.html) for greater
detail.

* [`std::fmt::DebugMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/struct.DebugMap.html)

#### `format_args`

Creates [`std::fmt::Arguments`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/struct.Arguments.html)
object containing precompiled format string and its arguments. Examples:
```rust
let args = format_args!("{} + {} = {}", 1, 2, 3);

println!("{:?}", args);
```

See [`std::format_args`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format_args.html)
and [`std::fmt::Arguments`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/struct.Arguments.html)
for greater detail.

#### `println`

Prints interpolated format string and the new line character to the standard
output. Examples:
```rust
println!("Hello, World!");
println!("Hello, {}!", "World");
```

See [`std::println`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html) for
greater detail.

#### `eprintln`

Like `println` but prints the output to standard error output.

See [`std::eprintln`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.eprintln.html) for
greater detail.

#### `dbg`

Prints to the standard error output and returns the value of given expression.
The value is moved. The type of the value must implement
[`std::fmt::Debug`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html) trait.
Examples:
```rust
let a = dbg!(2 + 5);  // Prints: [src/main.rs:2] 2 + 5 = 7

#[derive(Debug)]
struct NoCopy(u32);

let a = NoCopy(8);
let _ = dbg!(a);
let _ = dbg!(a);  // Error! (`a` was moved)
```

See [`std::dbg`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.dbg.html) for greater
detail.

## Attributes

Grammar:
```
inner_attribute:
    "#" "!" "[" attr "]"

outer_attribute:
    "#" "[" attr "]"

attr:
    simple_path attr_input?
attr_input:
    delim_token_tree
    "=" expression
```

### Selected Attributes Supported by Rust

#### `derive`

Allows new items to be automatically generated for data structures. Examples:
```rust
// Implement `std::fmt::Debug` trait for `Point`
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let p = Point {x: 1, y: 2};

println!("{p:#?}");  // Pretty print `p`
```
